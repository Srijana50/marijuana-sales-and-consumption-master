# marijuana-sales-and-consumption
The main purpose behind this project to answer the question of whether medical and recreational legalization of marijuana changed consumer behavior by examining price per gram and number of sales.
From a classification model borne of binning the price per gram, there appeared to be no significant effect from observing Washington and Colorado. The consumers already had reliable under the table methods of acquiring marijuana that did not change significantly from its legalization.
